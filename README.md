# "no"zippyfs
distributed file system in fuse  
Original version: branch distfs  

This one is like btrfs meets dropbox  
without the zip archives of the old version for efficiency's sake  
Features (so far):  
everything in distfs + in memory cache for reads / writes  
(soon) persistent b-tree replacing zip archive directory  

How to install:  
How to use:
