- normalize block cache map
- work on file backing normalized maps

- speed up sync transfers

what needs to be flushed for sync to be fast

- at minimum: path, blocks, mtime
- inode number for each process's btree

plan:
- root files are named <rand hex>.root
- each root file is in the format [(inode#, .node file)...], keys are inode#, values are .node files
- create files with name <rand hex>.node
- files start with a list of <inode#, offset into file>
- at the given offset format: (stat info, blocks)
