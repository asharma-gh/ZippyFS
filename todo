- add blocks to block map


- normalize block cache map
- move away from meta_data_ into multiple maps
    - data is separated to make loading / flushing easier
- add a map for .node file contents

- store written blocks for flushing, avoid copying redundant blocks!


Initial Plan for data format (simulate zip archives, but without the zipping!!)
- so by flushing the map, 2 files are created: .head and .node
- the .head and .node files are named the same, and a .head file contains the offset# and size for inode information within the .node files
(.head is == to .idx and .node == .zip)
- each .node file contains the information for the flushed inodes: inode stat info, block#s and block contents

Issue:
- putting together a file with blocks spread across .node files

solution: maintain .root files which contain records (inode#, [list of .head files])

Issue:
- finding latest version of a file
solution: check timestamps of each root file, take the latest one

Issue:
- finding old info for an inode in new root
solution: copy old info over, append new .head file

What this should look like:
[list-of root], root is [list of (inode#, list of .head)]
and a [list of .head + .node]

searching for a file is pretty slow, but moving from this to a tree shouldn't be that bad. Roots can be cached

- remove garbage collection for now
