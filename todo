- clean up b tree and loader
- add internal and leaf node
- Currently, both node and internal_nodes contain value pointers, this should not be necessary since all the values are on the leaf nodes
anyways.
 - refactor our the value parameter
 - ensure that all of the values are located in the leaf nodes
 - set up pointers between each leaf node
- change pointers to allow for multiple tree references
- add tree-ptr table
- integrate merging on trees
- separate root node and internal, leaf nodes
======
- unlinking, removals
- access / chmod stuff
- group / user permissions
- test over network
-
- general testing
